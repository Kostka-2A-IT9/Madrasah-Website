<p style="margin-top:10;font-size:15">

Our proposed project is integrated with our SIP or Science Investigatory Project entitled "The Effect of Compost Pits as an Alternative Fertilizer to the Phaseolus Vulgaris Seeds (String Beans)". After 2-3 months of growing the plants for our SIP, our team will sell the string beans we will harvest in our own backyards and give it to the institution as a start-up capital. The project is expected to take about 62 days from the official implementation date to be fully accomplished. The project will kick-off with an orientation on how to plant the string beans, how to use the compost, and ways to sell or market the string beans. This then will be followed by the planting, a few of the string beans harvested from our plants will be set-aside for the initial planting of our project. The string beans are expected to grow in a time span of 55 days, as compost pits are to be used as an organic fertilizer to boost the plants growth. Afterwards the harvested string beans are to be sold within the time span of a week. We plan to plant at least 50 string beans plant and sell at least 30 packs within our first selling month, with each pack being Php10/10 strings of string beans. The starting profit would be utilized directly in improving the Madaris and accumulating essential learning resources. Some seeds in the developed string beans will be processed and planted again to grow more quantity of string beans plants and possibly increase the income in the later years.

extension</span>Significance of project</span></h2>
<p>The objective of our proposed project is to help the institution in coming up with a solution towards the financial issue they are facing. We aim to suggest an alternative way for them to gain enough funds to sustain themselves and provide their needs without relying solely on government support and donations. Our project, “The Plant of ‘Amal”, involves the application of Urban Container Gardening and Compost pits as alternative fertilizers in growing the string beans. This decision was made to be able to promote a sustainable and green environment and to reduce food and plastic waste through recycling, reusing, and composting them. The string beans are easy and not-so-expensive to grow and maintain, and the project needs little to no monetary capital as it mostly relies on human efforts and resources aside from recycled materials, food waste, seeds, and water which makes it easier to accomplish than other alternative options, given the current financial situation of the institution.</p>

real_estate_agent</span>Project Background</h2>
<p>The MADRASAH is an institution providing educational opportunities for the Muslim youth and raising the platform of appreciating and embracing one's identity as part of a religion. The program's advocacy includes orienting the Muslim students about the Qur'an, Islamic Principles and Values, and Arabic Education, while at the same time hone their skills, knowledge, and talents to become better individuals with a brighter future ahead of them. The education is mostly beneficial to the families who experience poverty and don't have much money to put their children to school as aside from the fact that the institution welcomes to teach all religions, it also just costs Php 250 a year per family.The Madrasah in Sanggilangan Muslim Village covered court located in Ma-a was established 42 years ago during Mayor Lopez's term but was only institutitonalized during Mayor Inday Sarah's mayoral term. The institution currently has a population of 163 students from kinder to grade 6, whom rely on the Madrasah to be taught of Islamic Values and experience a quality Arabic education.</p>
