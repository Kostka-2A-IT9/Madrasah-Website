<h2>Problem Statement</h2>


<p style="padding-top:20">This experiment is conducted to identify the effectiveness of a compost pit as an alternative for synthetic fertilizers on the Phaseolus Vulgaris plant’s growth rate. As our partner institution is struggling with finances, we seek to help them find a method to grow healthy plants within a faster time without the need of having much expenses or spending a lot as we wanted to plant the String Beans plant as an asset and investment for the institution. From our chemistry class we have learned that potassium and calcium carbonate are elements essential for healthy plant growth that makes it a primary and usual component for great fertilizers. Calcium carbonate increases soil fertility and makes plants better assimilate nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium (Anivi, 2021). Potassium helps regulate exchange of water, oxygen, and carbon dioxide in the plant from regulating the opening and closing of the stomata thus also reduces yield and stunts plant growth(University of Minesota, n.d). Thus, both potassium which is a chemical element richly found in banana peels and calcium carbonate which is a chemical compound(calcium, oxygen, and carbon) found in eggshells are highly contributive in growing healthy String Beans plants faster. In our advantage these are what we usually consume everyday as these are essential for our nutrition as they are part of the “grow” and “glow” food groups, that means we can easily gather and utilize these wastes from the food we consumed into creating a compost pit as an an organic fertilizer as an alternative for synthetic ones that will result to giving us less expenses. The MADRASAH community can benefit from this as it could lessen their expenses on synthetic fertilizers and reduce their waste contributing to the environment through recycling and reusing food waste or leftovers to use as an organic fertilizer instead of synthetic fertilizers, which is said to have just the same effectivity on the plants that is yet to be proven through this study. </p>

<h2>Background and significance of the project</h2>


<p style="padding-top:20">The Institution has been lacking and struggling to manage their funds for its growth and development as we have seen in the MADRASAH PROFILING. As an organization promoting help for Madrasah, it is our role to contribute support in anyways we can as youth. Given our limited resources as students we decided to match our resources with the identified issue through the “NARM” process, through this we came up with the idea of growing string beans for the educational benefit of the students from learning about marketing, economic, and entrepreneurial concepts, having back-up food resources for the institution to also promote a healthy lifestyle, and a possible additional income to increase the institution’s funds. Since we are doing this online and have not gained much information about the Madaris’ establishment or the “Sanggilangan Muslim Village Covered Court”, we are unsure if there is a good gardening location with rich soil to grow a healthy plant within the institution’s location. This is why we have decided to use the Urban Container Gardening (UCG) method of planting to be assured that with or without a good soil to plant we still will be able to grow the string beans through recycling and reusing used and old plastics. Factors such as the Phaseolus Vulgaris seedlings are affordable to plant thus will not need as much financial capital, simpler to grow, is compatible with the UCG method, not as common as vegetables such as monggo, low maintenance, and a lot more we’re also considered in the planning of this experiment. Apart from this, growing healthy plants in a faster time was also considered upon deciding to plant the String Beans. Thus, through this study we aim to benefit the Muslim youth and communities through our partner institution, MADRASAH, with the use of compost pits as an alternative for synthetic fertilizers. This organic process of fertilizing the plants and boosting its growth will benefit them as it will serve as an opportunity for us to reduce the waste of the environment through reusing and utilizing food waste or leftovers in compost pits that will help in producing healthy plants, thus urges not only the institution but also the communities who’ll be inspired by it to start living a sustainable life, choosing organic options, and especially spending less for a fertilizer to be able to use more money for the development of more aspects and sectors of the institution without compromising the growth rate and health of the plants, String Beans to be exact for this experiment. </p>
