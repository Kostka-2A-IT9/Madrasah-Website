<h2>Background of the Project</h2>


<p>The issue on Arabic education has been stagnant across the country. A problem lying on the ground of education as a privilege rather than a right to the muslim children who seeks to be taught the message of the Qur'an. Madrasah's advocacy reaches out to the Muslim youth who needs provision of education and needs to be taught Islamic Values. Organizer's believe that this is key to attaining peace and order in the city, and could do so nationwide with enough support from our government. This system of education is unusual in the Philippines as teaching the lesson of Islamic Values is not often taught to us who's popularity are much more made up of Filipino christians. Our identity, however, is made up of our religion and culture, thus we need to know better of this for us to know better ourselves and our identity and have a great foundation of core values to prepare us towards the hurdles we'll face in the near future.</p>

<h2>Advocacy Plan</h2>

<p>As students of the Ateneo De Davao Junior High School (AdDU jhs), bringing up Ignatian Values, through the Christian Service Learning Program (CSLP) we aim to inspire and encourage others especially the youth to make a move and take a step towards a better and brighter future. Our organization "Uplift" hopes to be able help Muslim children reach their goals through our parter institution the "Madrasah". As fellow youth and students, we know the struggles of one to push oneself beyond their limits for improvement and growth, by which we see in the Muslim youth as well. We believe that education is not only for a specific group of people or religion, but rather for everyone to make a name for themselves, their families, and their religion or tribe. Thus we hope to be the bridge to connect Muslims to other ethics, religions, and cultures through this advocacy. It is more than what we desire that through this we will not only fulfill our responsibilities as servants of God, sisters and brothers to each one including the Muslim youth by utilizing our gifts to bless others but also encourage them in learning the Qur'an and Islamic values for Gods Glory. It is our goal to become enablers of developing a better environment and community for the next generations to come. Leading them to wiser choices in the future and following the pulse of their hearts with the purpose of glorifying God is what we're committed to achieve.</p>
